## CS-GO-Auto-Accept

A program which automatically accepts competitive matchmaking on CS:GO.
<br><br>
<b>Please note:</b> You need to open this program from the same monitor you opened CS:GO.
You cannot have CS:GO open on one monitor and start the program on another. Start the program
before you enter a queue, and use your customisable toggle hotkey to control the program :)
## FAQ
<li>Does this work with Panorama UI?</li>
As of 7/10/2018 it should work with the new Panorama UI. <br>
Please contact me or make an issue if you encounter problems.
<br><br>
<li>Can I get VACCED?</li>
No. The program doesn't make ANY modification to the actual game process.
<br><br>
<li>How do I change the hotkey?</li>
The program will ask you for a hotkey when you start it, make sure you use a single letter, no concatenating.<br>
If you want to change this value later, go to: C:\Potts' Software\CSGO Autoaccept\settings.ini
<br><br>
<li>Can this be abused?</li>
If you're asking whether this program can be used to accept matches to farm XP or something, then no - because you can still be kicked for being AFK,
the program will make no attempt to keep you from being kicked when you are in the game. It's simply made to allow you to enter a match without the
stress of being in front of your computer.
