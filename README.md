## FAQ

**Does this work with Panorama UI?**
As of 7/10/2018 it should work with the new Panorama UI. <br>
<br><br>
**Does it work with VAC?**
The program makes no modifications to the actual game process and should therefore be unseen by VAC.
<br><br>
**How do I change the hotkey?**
The program will ask you for a hotkey when you start it, make sure you use a single letter.<br>
If you want to change this value later, go to: C:\Potts' Software\CSGO Autoaccept\settings.ini
<br><br>
**Can this be abused?**
This program will not help you stay AFK in matches, it simply an auto-clicker for the match accept button.
