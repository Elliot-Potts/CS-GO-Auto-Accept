## FAQ
<li>Can I get VACCED?</li>
No. The program doesn't make ANY modification to the actual game process.
<br><br>
<li>How do I change the hotkey?</li>
The program will ask you for a hotkey when you start it, make sure you use a single letter, no concatenating.<br>
If you want to change this value later, go to: C:\Potts' Software\CSGO Autoaccept\settings.ini
