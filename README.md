## CS-GO-Auto-Accept

A program which automatically accepts competitive matchmaking on CS:GO.
<br><br>
<b>Please note:</b> You need to open this program from the same monitor you opened CS:GO.
You cannot have CS:GO open on one monitor and start the program on another. Start the program
before you enter a queue, and use your customisable toggle hotkey to control the program :)
## FAQ
<li>Does this work with Panorama UI?</li>
As of 7/10/2018 it should work with the new Panorama UI. <br>
Please contact me or make an issue if you encounter problems.
<br><br>
<li>Can I get VACCED?</li>
No. The program doesn't make ANY modification to the actual game process.
<br><br>
<li>How do I change the hotkey?</li>
The program will ask you for a hotkey when you start it, make sure you use a single letter, no concatenating.<br>
If you want to change this value later, go to: C:\Potts' Software\CSGO Autoaccept\settings.ini

Any other questions, please ask.
